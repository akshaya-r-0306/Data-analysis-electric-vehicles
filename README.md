Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis
This project analyzes the distribution and trends in electric vehicle (EV) usage using the Electric Vehicle Population Data. The analysis focuses on understanding popular EV brands, their models, electric range, and how user preferences have evolved over time.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is:
Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv
It includes information such as:

Vehicle Make and Model

Electric Vehicle Type

Model Year

Electric Range

and other relevant fields

📊 Visualizations
The script generates the following visualizations:

Distribution of Electric Vehicle Types (Pie Chart)
Shows the percentage split between BEVs, PHEVs, etc.

Distribution of Vehicle Model Years (Histogram)
Displays how EV production has changed over time.

Number of Car Models by Brand (Bar Graph)
Highlights how many models each brand has produced.

Sales Share of Different Brands (Pie Chart)
Shows which brands dominate EV sales.

Tesla Car Models Sales (Pie Chart)
Focused breakdown of Tesla model popularity.

Tesla Model vs. Electric Range (Bar Chart)
Compares different Tesla models based on electric range.

Electric Range vs. Model Year (Scatter Plot)
Visualizes how electric range has evolved with model year.

Electric Range by Make (Horizontal Bar Graph)
Displays electric range for top-selling brands sorted in descending order.

🔍 Key Insights
People are increasingly preferring EVs over other types of vehicles.

While many renowned brands produce EVs (e.g., Audi, Hyundai, BMW), consumer choices aren't solely based on brand reputation.

Tesla is the top-selling EV brand, with Model Y and Model 3 being the most popular.

Electric range has significantly improved over the years.

Despite range being a key factor, consumers also consider other features before making a purchase.
